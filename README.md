# about
this is a light to dark mode button. i used a checkbox and addeventlistener elements
i made it so that when you clcick on the button the black circle switches over to the otherside of the button and the background changes from orange to black
. it also has a set time on it so that when it switches over its not so hard on the eyes and goes at a resonable pace

# Attributes

# problems
* one problem i had was in the css, all the colors are --primary color and --secondary color, but for some reason the secondary color when i switch it to dark mode the words js is cool seem to go away. 
* Also i wanted to add a sun icon onto my button and then when it is clicked it goes away but i couldent get that to fucntion.
