# about
this is a light to dark mode button. i used a checkbox and addeventlistener elements
i made it so that when you clcick on the button the black circle switches over to the otherside of te button and the background changes from orange to black
. it also has a sett time on it so that when it switches over its not so hard on the eyes and goes at a resonable pace
